# ScopedStorageDemo

A sample project explaining Scoped storage with different operations performed on file as well as Image.

Note: You have add if-else logics based on API levels as MediaStore APIs are available in latest versions only. I am providing here the sample for different operations with latest changes to demonstrate the usage as older one code you already have. You can use [Opting Out](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/use-cases#opt-out-scoped-storage) to opt out of storage till Android 10.
